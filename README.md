# Java-Learning

📌 This repository stores the code I wrote while learning **Java**.  
Most of the code comes from class exercises, after-class practice, and self-learning projects.  
The main purpose is to **record my learning journey, build programming experience, and strengthen the fundamentals**.

## 🗂️ Repository Contents
- Basic syntax practice (variables, conditions, loops, etc.)
- Object-Oriented Programming (classes, inheritance, polymorphism, interfaces)
- Common API usage (collections, strings, IO, exception handling)
- Small projects or exercises (simple algorithms, console mini-games, etc.)

I will keep updating this repository as I learn new concepts and techniques.
